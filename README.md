- 👋 Hi, I’m Kristopher
- 👀 I’m interested in creating custom software tools and desktop productivity applications for business and personal use. I mainly develop custom software tools/apps and embeded code for configuration, wireless, Ethernet, serial communication and monitoring and more including artificial intelligence powered applications.
- 🌱 I continue learning more about java, css,html5, web based applications with backend web server, using python with front end java using synchronous and asynchronous. Im currently developing chat UI for AI models using ollama, flask, waitress,cloudflare,local host. The links to try the demo are here in my profile. Over time i have now become very proficient and creative in these areas.
